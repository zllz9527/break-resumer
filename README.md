# Break-Resumer

Break-Resumer is a project designed to handle breakpoint resume and instant file upload (秒传) functionalities. It allows users to upload files efficiently by splitting them into chunks and ensuring that already uploaded parts are not re-uploaded, enhancing the speed and reliability of file uploads.
